                    Idli, a staple of South Indian cuisine, is a beloved dish renowned for its soft, fluffy texture and mild, tangy flavor. Made from fermented rice and lentil batter, idlis are steamed to perfection in special molds, resulting in a healthy, low-calorie option ideal for breakfast or snacks. Often accompanied by sambar, coconut chutney, or other condiments, idli's versatility and nutritious profile have made it a popular choice not only in India but also worldwide, appreciated for its simplicity, taste, and ease of digestion.
